# Exploring Data Science

## OVERVIEW

For this project, we wrote a KNN Classifier, a Naive Bayes Classifier, and a Simple Regressor from scratch in C. We used python to pre-process and clean various datasets and performed classification problems on them.

## GOALS

1. Writing our own classifiers in C.
2. Working with datasets of various sizes.
3. Understanding data science techniques.
4. Using python to clean datasets.
5. Using python libraries to do more challenging data science problems.
