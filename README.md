# Exploring Data Science

## OVERVIEW

We plan to use various Python and R libraries such as SciKit Learn, dplyr, data.table, Numpy, and
Matplotlib to work on a series of popular datasets. The idea is to familiarize ourselves with data
science libraries and get a feel of working with datasets of various sizes. We shall also use
various techniques for data cleaning and as an optional part, we aim to scrape some primary data
and work on it.

## GOALS

1. Effectively using SciKit Learn.
2. Working with datasets of various sizes.
3. Understanding data science techniques.
Optionally, we want to:
1. Visualize the results
2. Create a GUI for each of these datasets.
